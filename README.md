Rust library that uses [cue](https://cuelang.org/).

Not called `cue` because another project has that name (not related to `cuelang`) and `rscue` keeps getting auto-corrected to `rescue`.

## Plan/Goals

Taking my time with this as I learn Cue.

Implementing this library via using the `cue` cli will the a different experience than using the Go library.

Right now this project is more about learing Cue and practicing Rust than it is about making a real product.

Hopefully the by-product of this effort will result in a vialble library.
